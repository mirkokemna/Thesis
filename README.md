# Thesis on "Reduced Order Models for Fluid Flow With Generative Adversarial Networks"
This repository was created as part of my Master's thesis at TU Delft.
Besides the thesis itself, it contains the code used to create the training data, the code used to build and train the models.

To create a new dataset, run the create_dataset.py script in the data_gen directory.
