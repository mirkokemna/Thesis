# Thesis on "Reduced Order Models for Fluid Flow With Generative Adversarial Networks"
This repository was created as part of my Master's thesis at TU Delft.
Besides the thesis itself, it contains the code used to create the training data, the code used to build and train the models, as well as a live demonstration script.

To create a new dataset, run the create_dataset.py script in the data_gen directory.

To use the live-predict tool, run the live_predict.py script from within the live_predict directory.
